# Getting started

## Overview

Stapifaction is a Rust library allowing to easily generate [static APIs],
by just decorating your existing structs with `#[derive]` attributes.
It works as a [Serde] superset to define how your structs are persisted
on disk.

## Installation

Add the following line to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
stapifaction = { version = "0.1", features = ["json"] }
```

## Basic example

Let's start by writing a very basic program persisiting a struct. In the
following example, with the `json` feature and `stapifaction::json::ToJson`
in scope, you can call `to_json()` to serialize the `User` struct to a JSON
file, using [Serde] behind the scenes.

:::code-group
```rust [Code]
// [!include ~/snippets/basic.rs]
```

<div data-title="Result">
  <Files files={{".": ["data.json"]}} />
</div>
:::

Running the code above will create a `./data.json` file. Have a look at the
[supported Serde attributes] if you want to customize how structs are
serialized.
