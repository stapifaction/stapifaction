# Getting started

## Overview

Stapifaction is a Rust library allowing to easily generate [static APIs],
by just decorating your existing structs with `#[derive]` attributes.
It works as a [Serde] superset to define how your structs are persisted
on disk.

## Installation

Run the following Cargo command in your project directory:

```sh
cargo add stapifaction
```

Or add the following line to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
stapifaction = "0.0.2"
```

## Basic example

Let's start by writing a very basic program persisiting a struct. In the
following example, we use the default `json` feature to serialize the `User`
struct to a JSON file, using [Serde].

:::code-group
```rust [Code]
// [!include ~/snippets/basic.rs]
```

<div data-title="Result">
  <Files files={{".": ["data.json"]}} />
</div>
:::

Running the code above will create a `./data.json` file. Have a look at the
[supported Serde attributes] if you want to customize how structs are
serialized.
