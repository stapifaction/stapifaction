# Stapifaction

Stapifaction is a Rust library allowing to easily generate [static APIs],
by just decorating your existing structs with `#[derive]` attributes.
It works as a [Serde] superset to define how your structs are persisted
on disk.

You can have a look at the [docs] to help you get started. There are also some
[examples] available.
